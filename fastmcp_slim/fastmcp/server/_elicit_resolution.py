"""Declarative elicitation: fill a parameter by asking the client for it.

PROVISIONAL INTERNAL MODULE — do not import from here.

The public name is `fastmcp.elicitation.Elicit`. This module holds the engine
behind it, and the engine is scheduled to move into the `uncalled-for`
dependency package once that package can *inject* a value from `Annotated`
metadata (today its annotation path runs a dependency for its side effects and
discards the result, so a marker in an annotation cannot fill a parameter).

When that lands, `Elicit` becomes an ordinary `uncalled_for.Dependency`
subclass, the scanning and ordering below is deleted in favour of the engine's
own DAG walk, and only the MCP-specific parts — rendering a question, recording
an answer, digesting, and choosing a transport for the protocol era — stay in
FastMCP. Nothing here is public API and none of it carries a deprecation
guarantee.

A parameter annotated `Annotated[T, Elicit("...")]` is filled by asking the
client instead of by the model, and is hidden from the tool's input schema. How
the ask reaches the user depends on the negotiated protocol:

- 2026-07-28 and later: there is no server-initiated back-channel (SEP-2577), so
  every unanswered question is batched into one `InputRequiredResult` and the
  body does not run. The client answers and re-issues the call; the parameters
  resolve from those answers and the body runs. Answers from earlier rounds ride
  `request_state`, which the framework seals before it reaches the wire.
- 2025-11-25 and earlier: the back-channel exists, so each question is asked
  in-process with `ctx.elicit()` while the call is still open.

The same annotated function works on both. That bridge is the point of the
declarative form: the framework can only choose a transport when the ask is not
already hard-coded into the body's control flow.

Questions are pinned to a digest of exactly what the client was shown, so a
redeploy that rewords a question — or a retry that changes an argument feeding
one — re-asks it rather than silently reusing an answer to a different question.

    """A request for the user to supply a value.

    Used in two positions, meaning the same thing in both.

    As parameter metadata it says the parameter is filled by asking rather than
    by the model, and the annotated type is the schema for the answer — scalars,
    `Literal`s, enums, dataclasses, and models all behave as they do with
    `ctx.elicit()`:

    ```python
    destination: Annotated[str, Elicit("Where would you like to fly?")]
    ```

    Returned from a resolver it is the question that resolver decided to ask.
    A resolver returns `T | Elicit[T]`, so returning a value instead skips the
    question entirely:

    ```python
    def which_airport(destination: str, profile: Profile = Depends(get_profile)) -> Airport | Elicit[Airport]:
        if profile.home_airport:
            return profile.home_airport
        return Elicit(f"Which airport in {destination}?", elicit_type=Airport)


    airport: Annotated[Airport, Elicit(which_airport)]
    ```

    A parameter with a default is optional: declining or cancelling leaves the
    default in place and the call proceeds. A parameter without one is required,
    and declining it fails the call.

    Args:
        question: The text to show the user, or a resolver that decides. A
            resolver's parameters are filled by name from the call's own
            arguments and from other elicited parameters, which is also what
            orders the asks; it may declare its own `Depends(...)` parameters,
            and it may be sync or async.
        elicit_type: The type to ask for. State it when constructing an `Elicit`
            inside a resolver, where the parameter's annotation is not in view.
            Omitted, the parameter's own annotation is used.
