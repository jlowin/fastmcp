[FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) is a managed platform for hosting MCP servers, built by the FastMCP team. While the FastMCP framework will always be fully open-source, we created FastMCP Cloud to solve the deployment challenges we've seen developers face. Our goal is to provide the absolute fastest way to make your MCP server available to LLM clients like Claude and Cursor. 

FastMCP Cloud is a young product and we welcome your feedback. Please join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/aGsSC3yDF4) to share your thoughts and ideas, and you can expect to see new features and improvements every week.

FastMCP Cloud is completely free while in beta!

## Getting Started

Deploying to FastMCP Cloud takes just three simple steps.

### Step 1: Create a Project

Visit [fastmcp.cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud) and sign in with your GitHub account. Create a project either by selecting an existing repository or using the FastMCP Cloud quickstart repo.

### Step 2: Configure Your Server

The configuration screen lets you specify:
- **Name**: The name of your project. This will be used to generate a unique URL for your server.
- **Entrypoint**: The Python file containing your FastMCP server (e.g., `echo.py`). This field has the same syntax as the `fastmcp run` command, for example `echo.py:my_server` to specify a specific object in the file.
- **Authentication**: If disabled, your server is open to the public. If enabled, only other members of your FastMCP Cloud organization will be able to connect.

Note that FastMCP Cloud will automatically detect yours server's Python dependencies from either a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` file.

### Step 3: Deploy

Once you create your project, FastMCP Cloud will:
1. Create the repository (if using quickstart)
2. Build your FastMCP server
3. Deploy it to a unique URL
4. Make it immediately available for connections

## Connect to Your Server

Your deployed server will be accessible at a URL like:

```
https://your-project-name.fastmcp.app/mcp
```

You should be able to connect to it as soon as you see the deployment succeed! In addition, you can instantly connect your server to a variety of popular LLM clients:

## Testing Changes

Any time you open a PR to your connected repo, FastMCP Cloud will create a new server for that branch and deploy it on a unique URL. This allows you to test your changes before merging to production. Each merge to main will trigger a new deployment of the "production" version of your server.
