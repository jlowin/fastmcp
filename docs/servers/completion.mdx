Completion allows MCP servers to offer argument autocompletion suggestions for prompts and resource URIs. This enables rich, IDE-like experiences where users receive contextual suggestions while entering argument values.

<Tip>
Most of the examples in this document assume you have a FastMCP server instance named `mcp`.

## What is Completion?

Completion in MCP is designed to support interactive user experiences similar to IDE code completion.
For example, applications may show completion suggestions in a dropdown or popup menu as users type, with the ability to filter and select from available options.
However, implementations are free to expose completion through any interface pattern that suits their needsâ€”the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

### Basic Usage

Use annoted parameters to add support for completion.

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.completion import StaticCompletion

mcp = FastMCP("Completion Server")

@mcp.prompt
async def country_info(
    country_name: Annotated[
        str,
        Field(description="Country name"),
        StaticCompletion(["Belgium", "Ukraine", "France"]),
    ],
) -> str:
    """Get more information about a given country."""
    return f"Tell me more about {country_name}"

@mcp.resource(
    name="get_country",
    uri="country://{id}",
    description="Fetch details of a country by its ISO3 code.",
    mime_type="application/json",
)
async def get_country(
    id: Annotated[
        str,
        Field(description="Country ISO3 code"),
        StaticCompletion(["Belgium (bel)", "Ukraine (ukr)", "France (fra)"]),
    ],
    ctx: Context
) -> dict:
    """
    Input:
        id (str): The country to fetch.
        ctx (Context): The context object for logging and tool state.
    Output:
        dict: The detailed country as a dictionary.
    """
    await ctx.info(f"Fetching country {id} from API.")
    try:
        # Extract id if specified between brackets.
        # Format is "Country name (id)"
        if "(" in id and ")" in id:
            id = id.split("(")[1].split(")")[0].strip()

        return api_get_country(id)
    except Exception as e:
        raise ToolError("Unable to load country, try again later.")

```
