<VersionBadge version="2.12.0" />

The OAuth proxy enables FastMCP servers to authenticate with OAuth providers that **don't support Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)**. This includes virtually all traditional OAuth providers: GitHub, Google, Azure, AWS, Discord, Facebook, and most enterprise identity systems. For providers that do support DCR (like Descope and WorkOS AuthKit), use [`RemoteAuthProvider`](/servers/auth/remote-oauth) instead.

MCP clients expect to register automatically and obtain credentials on the fly, but traditional providers require manual app registration through their developer consoles. The OAuth proxy bridges this gap by presenting a DCR-compliant interface to MCP clients while using your pre-registered credentials with the upstream provider. When a client attempts to register, the proxy returns your fixed credentials. When a client initiates authorization, the proxy handles the complexity of callback forwardingâ€”storing the client's dynamic callback URL, using its own fixed callback with the provider, then forwarding back to the client after token exchange.

This approach enables any MCP client (whether using random localhost ports or fixed URLs like Claude.ai) to authenticate with any traditional OAuth provider, all while maintaining full OAuth 2.1 and PKCE security.

<Note>
  For providers that support OIDC discovery (Auth0, Google with OIDC
  configuration, Azure AD), consider using [`OIDC
  Proxy`](/servers/auth/oidc-proxy) for automatic configuration. OIDC Proxy
  extends the OAuth proxy to automatically discover endpoints from the provider's
  `/.well-known/openid-configuration` URL, simplifying setup.
</Note>

## Implementation

### Provider Setup Requirements

Before using the OAuth proxy, you need to register your application with your OAuth provider:

1. **Register your application** in the provider's developer console (GitHub Settings, Google Cloud Console, Azure Portal, etc.)
2. **Configure the redirect URI** as your FastMCP server URL plus your chosen callback path:
   - Default: `https://your-server.com/auth/callback`
   - Custom: `https://your-server.com/your/custom/path` (if you set `redirect_path`)
   - Development: `http://localhost:8000/auth/callback`
3. **Obtain your credentials**: Client ID and Client Secret
4. **Note the OAuth endpoints**: Authorization URL and Token URL (usually found in the provider's OAuth documentation)

<Warning>
  The redirect URI you configure with your provider must exactly match your
  FastMCP server's URL plus the callback path. If you customize `redirect_path`
  in the OAuth proxy, update your provider's redirect URI accordingly.
</Warning>

### Basic Setup

Here's how to implement the OAuth proxy with any provider:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from fastmcp.server.auth import OAuthProxy
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.jwt import JWTVerifier

# Configure token verification for your provider
# See the Token Verification guide for provider-specific setups
token_verifier = JWTVerifier(
    jwks_uri="https://your-provider.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
    issuer="https://your-provider.com",
    audience="your-app-id"
)

# Create the OAuth proxy
auth = OAuthProxy(
    # Provider's OAuth endpoints (from their documentation)
    upstream_authorization_endpoint="https://provider.com/oauth/authorize",
    upstream_token_endpoint="https://provider.com/oauth/token",

    # Your registered app credentials
    upstream_client_id="your-client-id",
    upstream_client_secret="your-client-secret",

    # Token validation (see Token Verification guide)
    token_verifier=token_verifier,

    # Your FastMCP server's public URL
    base_url="https://your-server.com",

    # Optional: customize the callback path (default is "/auth/callback")
    # redirect_path="/custom/callback",
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server", auth=auth)
```

  provider's tokens
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="base_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str" required>
  Public URL of your FastMCP server (e.g., `https://your-server.com`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="redirect_path" type="str" default="/auth/callback">
  Path for OAuth callbacks. Must match the redirect URI configured in your OAuth
  application
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="upstream_revocation_endpoint" type="str | None">
  Optional URL of provider's token revocation endpoint
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="issuer_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str | None">
  Issuer URL for OAuth metadata (defaults to base_url)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="service_documentation_url" type="AnyHttpUrl | str | None">
  Optional URL to your service documentation
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="forward_pkce" type="bool" default="True">
  Whether to forward PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) to the upstream OAuth
  provider. When enabled and the client uses PKCE, the proxy generates its own
  PKCE parameters to send upstream while separately validating the client's
  PKCE. This ensures end-to-end PKCE security at both layers (client-to-proxy
  and proxy-to-upstream). - `True` (default): Forward PKCE for providers that
  support it (Google, Azure, AWS, GitHub, etc.) - `False`: Disable only if upstream
  provider doesn't support PKCE
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="token_endpoint_auth_method" type="str | None">
  Token endpoint authentication method for the upstream OAuth server. Controls
  how the proxy authenticates when exchanging authorization codes and refresh
  tokens with the upstream provider. - `"client_secret_basic"`: Send credentials
  in Authorization header (most common) - `"client_secret_post"`: Send
  credentials in request body (required by some providers) - `"none"`: No
  authentication (for public clients) - `None` (default): Uses authlib's default
  (typically `"client_secret_basic"`) Set this if your provider requires a
  specific authentication method and the default doesn't work.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="allowed_client_redirect_uris" type="list[str] | None">
  List of allowed redirect URI patterns for MCP clients. Patterns support
  wildcards (e.g., `"http://localhost:*"`, `"https://*.example.com/*"`). -
  `None` (default): All redirect URIs allowed (for MCP/DCR compatibility) -
  Empty list `[]`: No redirect URIs allowed - Custom list: Only matching
  patterns allowed These patterns apply to MCP client loopback redirects, NOT
  the upstream OAuth app redirect URI.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="valid_scopes" type="list[str] | None">
  List of all possible valid scopes for the OAuth provider. These are advertised
  to clients through the `/.well-known` endpoints. Defaults to `required_scopes`
  from your TokenVerifier if not specified.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="extra_authorize_params" type="dict[str, str] | None">
  Additional parameters to forward to the upstream authorization endpoint. Useful for provider-specific parameters that aren't part of the standard OAuth2 flow.
  
  For example, Auth0 requires an `audience` parameter to issue JWT tokens:
  ```python
  extra_authorize_params={"audience": "https://api.example.com"}
  ```
  
  These parameters are added to every authorization request sent to the upstream provider.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="extra_token_params" type="dict[str, str] | None">
  Additional parameters to forward to the upstream token endpoint during code exchange and token refresh. Useful for provider-specific requirements during token operations.

For example, some providers require additional context during token exchange:

```python
extra_token_params={"audience": "https://api.example.com"}
```

These parameters are included in all token requests to the upstream provider.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="client_storage" type="KVStorage | None">
  Storage backend for persisting OAuth client registrations. By default, clients are automatically persisted to disk in `~/.config/fastmcp/oauth-proxy-clients/`, allowing them to survive server restarts as long as the filesystem remains accessible. This means MCP clients only need to register once and can reconnect seamlessly after your server restarts.

```python
from fastmcp.utilities.storage import InMemoryStorage

# Use in-memory storage for testing (clients lost on restart)
auth = OAuthProxy(..., client_storage=InMemoryStorage())
```

</ParamField>
</Card>

### Using Built-in Providers

FastMCP includes pre-configured providers for common services:

```python
from fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github import GitHubProvider

auth = GitHubProvider(
    client_id="your-github-app-id",
    client_secret="your-github-app-secret",
    base_url="https://your-server.com"
)

mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server", auth=auth)
```

Available providers include `GitHubProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and others. These handle token verification automatically.

### Token Verification

The OAuth proxy requires a compatible `TokenVerifier` to validate tokens from your provider. Different providers use different token formats:

- **JWT tokens** (Google, Azure): Use `JWTVerifier` with the provider's JWKS endpoint
- **Opaque tokens with RFC 7662 introspection** (Auth0, Okta, WorkOS): Use `IntrospectionTokenVerifier`
- **Opaque tokens (provider-specific)** (GitHub, Discord): Use provider-specific verifiers like `GitHubTokenVerifier`

See the [Token Verification guide](/servers/auth/token-verification) for detailed setup instructions for your provider.

### Scope Configuration

OAuth scopes control what permissions your application requests from users. They're configured through your `TokenVerifier` (required for the OAuth proxy to validate tokens from your provider). Set `required_scopes` to automatically request the permissions your application needs:

```python
JWTVerifier(..., required_scopes = ["read:user", "write:data"])
```

Dynamic clients created by the proxy will automatically include these scopes in their authorization requests. See the [Token Verification](#token-verification) section below for detailed setup.

### Custom Parameters

Some OAuth providers require additional parameters beyond the standard OAuth2 flow. Use `extra_authorize_params` and `extra_token_params` to pass provider-specific requirements. For example, Auth0 requires an `audience` parameter to issue JWT tokens instead of opaque tokens:

```python
auth = OAuthProxy(
    upstream_authorization_endpoint="https://your-domain.auth0.com/authorize",
    upstream_token_endpoint="https://your-domain.auth0.com/oauth/token",
    upstream_client_id="your-auth0-client-id",
    upstream_client_secret="your-auth0-client-secret",

    # Auth0-specific audience parameter
    extra_authorize_params={"audience": "https://your-api-identifier.com"},
    extra_token_params={"audience": "https://your-api-identifier.com"},

    token_verifier=JWTVerifier(
        jwks_uri="https://your-domain.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
        issuer="https://your-domain.auth0.com/",
        audience="https://your-api-identifier.com"
    ),
    base_url="https://your-server.com"
)
```

The proxy also automatically forwards RFC 8707 `resource` parameters from MCP clients to upstream providers that support them.

```

The flow diagram above illustrates the complete OAuth proxy pattern. Let's understand each phase:

### Registration Phase

When an MCP client calls `/register` with its dynamic callback URL, the proxy responds with your pre-configured upstream credentials. The client stores these credentials believing it has registered a new app. Meanwhile, the proxy records the client's callback URL for later use.

### Authorization Phase

The client initiates OAuth by redirecting to the proxy's `/authorize` endpoint. The proxy:

1. Stores the client's transaction with its PKCE challenge
2. Generates its own PKCE parameters for upstream security
3. Shows the user a consent page with the client's details, redirect URI, and requested scopes
4. If the user approves (or the client was previously approved), redirects to the upstream provider using the fixed callback URL

This dual-PKCE approach maintains end-to-end security at both the client-to-proxy and proxy-to-provider layers. The consent step protects against confused deputy attacks by ensuring you explicitly approve each client before it can complete authorization.

### Callback Phase

After user authorization, the provider redirects back to the proxy's fixed callback URL. The proxy:

1. Exchanges the authorization code for tokens with the provider
2. Stores these tokens temporarily
3. Generates a new authorization code for the client
4. Redirects to the client's original dynamic callback URL

### Token Exchange Phase

Finally, the client exchanges its authorization code with the proxy to receive the provider's tokens. The proxy validates the client's PKCE verifier before returning the stored tokens.

This entire flow is transparent to the MCP clientâ€”it experiences a standard OAuth flow with dynamic registration, unaware that a proxy is managing the complexity behind the scenes.

### PKCE Forwarding

The OAuth proxy automatically handles PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) when working with providers that support or require it. The proxy generates its own PKCE parameters to send upstream while separately validating the client's PKCE, ensuring end-to-end security at both layers.

This is enabled by default via the `forward_pkce` parameter and works seamlessly with providers like Google, Azure AD, and GitHub. Only disable it for legacy providers that don't support PKCE:

```python
# Disable PKCE forwarding only if upstream doesn't support it
auth = OAuthProxy(
    ...,
    forward_pkce=False  # Default is True
)
```

### Redirect URI Validation

While the OAuth proxy accepts all redirect URIs by default (for DCR compatibility), you can restrict which clients can connect by specifying allowed patterns:

```python
# Allow only localhost clients (common for development)
auth = OAuthProxy(
    # ... other parameters ...
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=[
        "http://localhost:*",
        "http://127.0.0.1:*"
    ]
)

# Allow specific known clients
auth = OAuthProxy(
    # ... other parameters ...
    allowed_client_redirect_uris=[
        "http://localhost:*",
        "https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback",
        "https://*.mycompany.com/auth/*"  # Wildcard patterns supported
    ]
)
```

Check your server logs for "Client registered with redirect_uri" messages to identify what URLs your clients use.

## Security

### Confused Deputy Attacks

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

A confused deputy attack allows a malicious client to steal your authorization by tricking you into granting it access under your identity.

The OAuth proxy works by bridging DCR clients to traditional auth providers, which means that multiple MCP clients connect through a single upstream OAuth application. An attacker can exploit this shared application by registering a malicious client with their own redirect URI, then sending you an authorization link. When you click it, your browser goes through the OAuth flowâ€”but since you may have already authorized this OAuth app before, the provider might auto-approve the request. The authorization code then gets sent to the attacker's redirect URI instead of a legitimate client, giving them access under your credentials.

#### Mitigation

FastMCP's OAuth proxy requires you to explicitly consent whenever any new or unrecognized client attempts to connect to your server. Before any authorization happens, you see a consent page showing the client's details, redirect URI, and requested scopes. This gives you the opportunity to review and deny suspicious requests. Once you approve a client, it's remembered so you don't see the consent page again for that client. The consent mechanism is implemented with CSRF tokens and cryptographically signed cookies to prevent tampering.

## Environment Configuration

<VersionBadge version="2.12.1" />

For production deployments, configure the OAuth proxy through environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials:

```bash
# Specify the provider implementation
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH=fastmcp.server.auth.providers.github.GitHubProvider

# Provider-specific credentials
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="Ov23li..."
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="abc123..."
export FASTMCP_SERVER_AUTH_GITHUB_BASE_URL="https://your-production-server.com"
```

With environment configuration, your server code simplifies to:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

# Authentication automatically configured from environment
mcp = FastMCP(name="My Server")

@mcp.tool
def protected_tool(data: str) -> str:
    """This tool is now protected by OAuth."""
    return f"Processed: {data}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="http", port=8000)
```
