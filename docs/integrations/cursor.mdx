# Cursor IDE Integration

FastMCP provides seamless integration with [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com), allowing you to use your MCP servers directly within Cursor's AI assistant.

## Installation

The FastMCP CLI includes a dedicated command for installing MCP servers in Cursor:

```bash
fastmcp cursor server.py
```

This command automatically:
- Detects your Cursor installation
- Configures the MCP server in Cursor's configuration file
- Optionally opens Cursor with a deeplink to highlight the newly installed server

## Basic Usage

### Installing a Simple Server

```bash
# Install with default settings
fastmcp cursor examples/simple_server.py

# Install with a custom name
fastmcp cursor server.py --name "My Custom Server"

# Install with environment variables
fastmcp cursor server.py -v API_KEY=secret -v MODEL=gpt-4
```

### Transport Options

Cursor supports two transport protocols for MCP servers:

1. **STDIO (default)** - For local servers
2. **SSE** - For remote servers

```bash
# Install with SSE transport for remote servers
fastmcp cursor server.py --transport sse
```

### Managing Dependencies

```bash
# Install with additional packages
fastmcp cursor server.py --with requests --with pandas

# Install with editable development package
fastmcp cursor server.py --with-editable ./my-package
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be provided via command line or from a file:

```bash
# From command line
fastmcp cursor server.py -v API_KEY=secret -v DEBUG=true

# From .env file
fastmcp cursor server.py --env-file .env
```

## Advanced Features

### Listing Installed Servers

View all MCP servers currently installed in Cursor:

```bash
fastmcp cursor --list
```

### Preventing Auto-Open

By default, the command tries to open Cursor after installation. To prevent this:

```bash
fastmcp cursor server.py --no-open
```

## Example

Here's a complete example of creating and installing a MCP server in Cursor:

1. Create a server file (`weather_server.py`):

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(
    "Weather Server",
    instructions="Provides weather information and forecasts"
)

@mcp.tool()
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a location."""
    # In a real server, this would call a weather API
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny and 72Â°F"

@mcp.tool()
def get_forecast(location: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for the next few days."""
    return f"{days}-day forecast for {location}: Partly cloudy with a chance of rain"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

2. Install it in Cursor:

```bash
fastmcp cursor weather_server.py --name "Weather Assistant"
```

3. Use it in Cursor by asking the AI assistant:
   - "What's the weather in New York?"
   - "Give me a 5-day forecast for San Francisco"

## Configuration File

The Cursor MCP configuration is stored in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. FastMCP automatically manages this file, but you can also edit it manually if needed:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Weather Assistant": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "fastmcp",
        "fastmcp",
        "run",
        "/path/to/weather_server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cursor Not Found

If you get a "Cursor not found" error:
1. Ensure Cursor IDE is installed
2. Make sure you've run Cursor at least once to create its configuration directory
3. Check that `~/.cursor` directory exists

### Server Not Appearing

If your server doesn't appear in Cursor after installation:
1. Restart Cursor completely
2. Check the configuration file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
3. Verify the server runs correctly with `fastmcp run server.py`

### Deeplink Not Working

If Cursor doesn't open automatically:
- This is normal on some systems
- Simply open Cursor manually and your server will be available
