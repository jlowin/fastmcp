<VersionBadge version="2.6.0" />

<Tip>
OAuth authentication is only relevant for HTTP-based transports and requires user interaction via a web browser.
</Tip>

When your FastMCP client needs to access an MCP server protected by OAuth 2.1, and the process requires user interaction (like logging in and granting consent), you should use the Authorization Code Flow. FastMCP provides the `fastmcp.client.auth.OAuth` helper to simplify this entire process.

This flow is common for user-facing applications where the application acts on behalf of the user.

## Client Usage


### Default Configuration

The simplest way to use OAuth is to pass the string `"oauth"` to the `auth` parameter of the `Client` or transport instance. FastMCP will automatically configure the client to use OAuth with default settings:

```python {4}
from fastmcp import Client

# Uses default OAuth settings
async with Client("https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp", auth="oauth") as client:
    await client.ping()
```


### `OAuth` Helper

To fully configure the OAuth flow, use the `OAuth` helper and pass it to the `auth` parameter of the `Client` or transport instance. `OAuth` manages the complexities of the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Code Grant with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security, and implements the full `httpx.Auth` interface.

```python {2, 4, 6}
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth

oauth = OAuth(mcp_url="https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp")

async with Client("https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp", auth=oauth) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

#### `OAuth` Parameters

- **`scopes`** (`str | list[str]`, optional): OAuth scopes to request. Can be space-separated string or list of strings
- **`client_name`** (`str`, optional): Client name for dynamic registration. Defaults to `"FastMCP Client"`
- **`client_metadata_url`** (`str`, optional): URL-based client identity (CIMD). See [CIMD Authentication](#cimd-authentication) below
- **`token_storage`** (`AsyncKeyValue`, optional): Storage backend for persisting OAuth tokens. Defaults to in-memory storage (tokens lost on restart). See [Token Storage](#token-storage) for encrypted storage options
- **`additional_client_metadata`** (`dict[str, Any]`, optional): Extra metadata for client registration
- **`callback_port`** (`int`, optional): Fixed port for OAuth callback server. If not specified, uses a random available port
- **`httpx_client_factory`** (`McpHttpClientFactory`, optional): Factory for creating httpx clients


## OAuth Flow

The OAuth flow is triggered when you use a FastMCP `Client` configured to use OAuth.

<Steps>
<Step title="Token Check">
The client first checks the configured `token_storage` backend for existing, valid tokens for the target server. If one is found, it will be used to authenticate the client.
</Step>
<Step title="OAuth Server Discovery">
If no valid tokens exist, the client attempts to discover the OAuth server's endpoints using a well-known URI (e.g., `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`) based on the `mcp_url`.
</Step>
<Step title="Client Registration">
If the OAuth server supports it and the client isn't already registered (or credentials aren't cached), the client performs dynamic client registration according to RFC 7591. Alternatively, if a `client_metadata_url` is configured and the server supports CIMD, the client uses its metadata URL as its identity instead of registering.
</Step>
<Step title="Local Callback Server">
A temporary local HTTP server is started on an available port (or the port specified via `callback_port`). This server's address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`) acts as the `redirect_uri` for the OAuth flow.
</Step>
<Step title="Browser Interaction">
The user's default web browser is automatically opened, directing them to the OAuth server's authorization endpoint. The user logs in and grants (or denies) the requested `scopes`.
</Step>
<Step title="Authorization Code & Token Exchange">
Upon approval, the OAuth server redirects the user's browser to the local callback server with an `authorization_code`. The client captures this code and exchanges it with the OAuth server's token endpoint for an `access_token` (and often a `refresh_token`) using PKCE for security.
</Step>
<Step title="Token Caching">
The obtained tokens are saved to the configured `token_storage` backend for future use, eliminating the need for repeated browser interactions.
</Step>
<Step title="Authenticated Requests">
The access token is automatically included in the `Authorization` header for requests to the MCP server.
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh Token">
If the access token expires, the client will automatically use the refresh token to get a new access token.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Token Storage

<VersionBadge version="2.13.0" />

By default, tokens are stored in memory and lost when your application restarts. For persistent storage, pass an `AsyncKeyValue`-compatible storage backend to the `token_storage` parameter.

<Warning>
**Security Consideration**: Use encrypted storage for production. MCP clients can accumulate OAuth credentials for many servers over time, and a compromised token store could expose access to multiple services.
</Warning>

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth
from key_value.aio.stores.disk import DiskStore
from key_value.aio.wrappers.encryption import FernetEncryptionWrapper
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import os

# Create encrypted disk storage
encrypted_storage = FernetEncryptionWrapper(
    key_value=DiskStore(directory="~/.fastmcp/oauth-tokens"),
    fernet=Fernet(os.environ["OAUTH_STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY"])
)

oauth = OAuth(
    mcp_url="https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp",
    token_storage=encrypted_storage
)

async with Client("https://your-server.fastmcp.app/mcp", auth=oauth) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

You can use any `AsyncKeyValue`-compatible backend from the [key-value library](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value) including Redis, DynamoDB, and more. Wrap your storage in `FernetEncryptionWrapper` for encryption.

<Note>
When selecting a storage backend, review the [py-key-value documentation](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value) to understand the maturity level and limitations of your chosen backend. Some backends may be in preview or have constraints that affect production suitability.
</Note>

## CIMD Authentication

<VersionBadge version="3.0.0" />

Client ID Metadata Documents (CIMD) provide an alternative to Dynamic Client Registration. Instead of registering with each server and receiving dynamically-generated credentials, your client hosts a static JSON document at an HTTPS URL. That URL becomes your client's identity.

CIMD is recommended for production applications because it provides verifiable identity through domain ownership. Servers can see exactly which domain is requesting access, and users see a verified badge in the consent screen.

### Using CIMD

To use CIMD, pass your metadata document URL to the `client_metadata_url` parameter:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from fastmcp.client.auth import OAuth

oauth = OAuth(
    client_metadata_url="https://myapp.example.com/oauth/client.json",
    # This URL becomes your client_id - the server fetches your metadata
    # from this URL instead of you registering via Dynamic Client Registration
)

async with Client("https://mcp-server.example.com", auth=oauth) as client:
    await client.ping()
```

When the server advertises CIMD support, the client uses your metadata URL as its `client_id` instead of performing Dynamic Client Registration. The server fetches your metadata document and uses it to configure the OAuth flow.

### Creating a CIMD Document

A CIMD document is a JSON file containing OAuth client metadata. The most important field is `client_id`, which must exactly match the URL where the document is hosted.

You can create a CIMD document using the FastMCP CLI:

```bash
fastmcp auth cimd create \
    --name "My Application" \
    --redirect-uri "http://localhost:*/callback"
```

This generates a document like:

```json
{
  "client_id": "https://YOUR-DOMAIN.com/path/to/client.json",
  "client_name": "My Application",
  "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost:*/callback"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_method": "none",
  "grant_types": ["authorization_code"],
  "response_types": ["code"]
}
```

Before hosting, update the `client_id` field to match the exact URL where you'll host the document.

### Hosting Requirements

CIMD documents must be hosted at an HTTPS URL with a non-root path. The URL requirements are:

- **HTTPS required**: HTTP URLs are rejected for security
- **Non-root path**: The URL must have a path component (e.g., `/oauth/client.json`, not just `/`)
- **Public accessibility**: The server must be able to fetch the document
- **Matching client_id**: The `client_id` field in the document must exactly match the hosting URL

Common hosting locations include:

- `https://myapp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-client.json`
- `https://myapp.example.com/oauth/client.json`
- Static file hosting services like GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or S3

### Validating Your Document

Before deploying, validate your hosted document:

```bash
fastmcp auth cimd validate https://myapp.example.com/oauth/client.json
```

The validator checks that:
- The URL is a valid CIMD URL (HTTPS, non-root path)
- The document is valid JSON
- The document conforms to the CIMD schema
- The `client_id` in the document matches the URL
